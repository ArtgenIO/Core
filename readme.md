Artgen has a simple goal, reduce the meaningless work for developers. As a developer your skills should be used to solve programming challanges, not to manage lists, or script rest endpoints. This is why Artgen provides you with a workflow engine, database manager, and a drag and drop user interface designer.

This project aims to eridicate all of those simple problems, while providing a toolset for everyone in your company to develop a useful product. Even tho, I have titled it as a headless CMS, but it aims to be much more than that.

How we gona achieve this enormous goal? With three main segment, as most of the programming work can be split into those categories.

First, managed data schema, Artgen comes with a built in SQL data model manager fully managed from a user interface. Your colleagues can create a new database table within seconds, and customize data relations on an visual interface.

Second, managed workflow. Most of the business logic are so simple that you can draw it to a napkin, this is why we have a visual workflow engine where you and everyone in the company simply reprogram the business flow by connecting nodes on a drawboard.

Third, managed graphical interface. Every data scheme automatically gets it's own CRUD page so you will never gona write a new list page, nor a create X form. This is easily the most wasteful work in your and your companies life.

What is left for you is to write real programs and let the rest of it to us <3

### Get Started!

```
Nope, don't do it just yet! You can install the repo, but it's just way too unstable for any kind of real life usage now :3
```

### Current Status

---

At this moment the project is just passed the initial validation, now we know this is a feasable and what we aim to do is not just a brain f\*rt. In the following weeks the repo will continiously gets stabilished, and when a segment is stable enough for testing will be documented.
